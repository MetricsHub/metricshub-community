# Configure the MetricsHub Agent

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

The **MetricsHub Agent** collects the health of the monitored resources and pushes the collected data to the OTLP receiver. **${solutionName}** then processes the resource observability and sustainability metrics and exposes them in the backend platform of your choice (Datadog, BMC Helix, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).

To ensure this process runs smoothly, you need to configure a few settings in the `config/metricshub.yaml` file to allow **${solutionName}** to:

* identify which site is monitored with this agent
* calculate the electricity costs and the carbon footprint of this site
* monitor the resources in this site.

> **Important**: We recommend using an editor supporting the [Schemastore](https://www.schemastore.org/json#editors) to edit **${solutionName}**'s configuration YAML files (Example: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), with [RedHat's YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)).

> **Note**: The configurations described on this page are applicable to the `metricshub.yaml` file:
> * On Windows, the `metricshub.yaml` configuration file is located at `C:\ProgramData\MetricsHub\config`.
> * On Linux, the `metricshub.yaml` configuration file is located at `./metricshub/lib/config`.

## Configure a site

A site represents the data center, the server room or any other site in which all the resources to be monitored are located.

In the `config/metricshub.yaml` file, establish a clear representation of your site by defining a `<resource-group-name>` within the designated `resourceGroups` section.
Subsequently, define the `site` attribute, under the `attributes` section of your resource group. The following example demonstrates the structured approach:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  <resource-group-name>:
    attributes:
      site: <site-name>
```

Replace `<resource-group-name>` with a unique identifier for your resource group and `<site-name>` with the designated name for your site as shown in the following example:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    attributes:
      site: boston
```

## Configure the sustainability settings


Once you've specified the `site` attribute within the `attributes` section of your resource group, take the next step to acquire insightful data regarding the electricity costs and carbon footprint of your site.
This involves configuring the `metrics` section within your resource group in the `config/metricshub.yaml` file, as demonstrated below:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  <resource-group-name>:
    attributes:
      site: <site-name>
    metrics:
      hw.site.carbon_intensity: <carbon-intensity-value> # in g/kWh
      hw.site.electricity_cost: <electricity-cost-value> # in $/kWh
      hw.site.pue: <pue-value>
```

where:
* `hw.site.carbon_intensity` is the **carbon intensity in grams per kiloWatthour**. This information is required to calculate the carbon emissions of your site. The carbon intensity corresponds to the amount of COâ‚‚ emissions produced per kWh of electricity and varies depending on the country and the region where the data center is located. See the [electricityMap Web site](https://app.electricitymap.org/map) for reference.
* `hw.site.electricity_cost` is the **electricity price in the currency of your choice per kiloWattHour**. This information is required to calculate the energy cost of your site. Refer to your energy contract to know the tariff by kilowatt per hour charged by your supplier or refer to the [GlobalPetrolPrices Web site](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/electricity_prices/). Make sure to always use the same currency for all instances of MetricsHub on all sites to allow cost aggregation in your dashboards that cover multiple sites.
* `hw.site.pue` is the **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** of your site. By default, sites are set with a PUE of 1.8, which is the average value for typical data centers.

Replace `<resource-group-name>`, `<site-name>`, `<carbon-intensity-value>`, `<electricity-cost-value>`, and `<pue-value>` with your specific resource group name, site name, and corresponding values for carbon intensity, electricity cost, and PUE. For example:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    attributes:
      site: boston
    metrics:
      hw.site.carbon_intensity: 350 # in g/kWh
      hw.site.electricity_cost: 0.12 # in $/kWh
      hw.site.pue: 1.8
```

## Configure monitored resources

To collect metrics from your resources, you must provide the following information in the `config/metricshub.yaml` file:

* the hostname of the resource to be monitored
* its type
* the protocol(s) to be used.

You can either configure your resources individually or several at a times if they share the same characteristics (device type, protocols, credentials, etc.).

### Monitored resources

If your intention is to associate monitored resources with a specific resource group, set up your resource within the `resources` section under the designated resource group identified by `<resource-group-name>`. Here's an illustrative example:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  <resource-group-name>:
    resources:
      <resource-id>:   
        attributes:
          host.name: <hostname>
          host.type: <type>
        <protocol-configuration>
```
This configuration is particularly useful when configuring the **MetricsHub Agent** to monitor multiple sites, where each site serves as a resource group containing various resources.

Alternatively, if you don't require the resource grouping feature, you can configure your resource directly under the `resources` section located at the top level in the `config/metricshub.yaml` file:

```yaml
resources:
  <resource-id>:   
    attributes:
      host.name: <hostname>
      host.type: <type>
    <protocol-configuration>
# resourceGroups: # not required
```
This approach is suitable when resource grouping is unnecessary for your monitoring setup.

where:

* `<resource-id>` is the unique id of your resource (e.g: host, application or service id)
* `<hostname>` is the name of the host resource, or its IP address.
* `<type>` is the type of the resource to be monitored. Possible values are:

  * `win` for Microsoft Windows systems
  * `linux` for Linux systems
  * `network` for network devices
  * `oob` for Out-of-band management cards
  * `storage` for storage systems
  * `aix` for IBM AIX systems
  * `hpux` for HP UX systems
  * `solaris` for Oracle Solaris systems
  * `tru64` for HP Tru64 systems
  * `vms` for HP Open VMS systems
    For the enterprise edition, refer to [Monitored Systems](../enterprise-platform-requirements.html) for more details.
    For the basic edition, refer to [Monitored Systems](../basic-platform-requirements.html) for more details.

* `<protocol-configuration>` is the protocol(s) **${solutionName}** will use to communicate with the resources: `http`, `ipmi`, `oscommand`, `ssh`, `snmp`, `wmi`, `wbem` or `winrm`. Refer to [Protocols and credentials](#protocol) for more details.

### Same characteristics resources

You can configure resources that share the same characteristics (device kind, protocols, credentials, etc.) using syntax below:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  <resource-group-name>:
    resources:
      <resource-id>:
        attributes:
          host.names: [<hostname1>,<hostname2>, etc.]
          host.type: <type>
        <protocol-configuration>
```

where:

* `<hostname1>,<hostname2>, etc.` is a comma-delimited list of host resources to be monitored. Provide their hostname or IP address.
* `<type>` is the type of the resource to be monitored.
* `<protocol-configuration>` is the protocol(s) **${solutionName}** will use to communicate with the resource: `http`, `ipmi`, `oscommand`, `ssh`, `snmp`, `wmi`, `wbem` or `winrm`. Refer to [Protocols and credentials](#protocol) for more details.

            authentications: [ntlm]
```

## Additional settings (Optional)

### Authentication settings

#### Basic authentication header

In the community edition, by default, the **MetricsHub Agent**'s internal `OTLP Exporter` operates without authentication when communicating with the `OTLP Receiver`.

If your `OTLP Receiver` requires authentication headers, you will need to manually configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers` parameters under the `otel` section in your configuration file:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers: <custom-header1>
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers: <custom-header2>

resourceGroups: # ...
```

On the other hand, the enterprise edition updates the community edition's behavior. The **MetricsHub Agent**'s internal `OTLP Exporter` includes the HTTP  `Authorization` request header to authenticate itself with the _OpenTelemetry Collector_'s [OTLP gRPC Receiver](configure-otel.md#OTLP_gRPC). A predefined *Basic Authentication Header* value is stored internally and included in each request when sending telemetry data.

To customize the default value of the `OTLP Exporter` header, set the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers` parameters under the `otel` section in your configuration file:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers: Authorization=Basic <base64-credentials>
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers: Authorization=Basic <base64-credentials>

resourceGroups: # ...
```

where `<base64-credentials>` are built by first joining your username and password with a colon (`myUsername:myPassword`) and then encoding the value in `base64`.

> **Warning**: If you update the *Basic Authentication Header*, you must generate a new `.htpasswd` file for the [OpenTelemetry Collector Basic Authenticator](configure-otel.md#Basic_Authenticator).

#### OTLP endpoint

The **MetricsHub Agent**'s internal `OTLP Exporter` pushes telemetry [signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/) to the [`OTLP Receiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver/otlpreceiver) through [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) on port **TCP/4317**.

By default, the internal `OTLP Exporter` is configured to push data to the `OTLP Receiver` endpoint `https://localhost:4317`.

To override the OTLP endpoints, configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint` parameters under the `otel` section in your configuration file:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint: https://my-host:4317
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint: https://my-host:4317

resourceGroups: #...
```

#### Example Configuration for the **MetricsHub Agent** Community Edition to Transmit Metrics to the Prometheus OTLP Receiver

```yaml
otel:
  otel.metrics.exporter: otlp
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint: http://<prom-server-host>:9090/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.protocol: http/protobuf
```

Replace `<prom-server-host>` with the server's hostname or IP address where *Prometheus* is running.

> **Note:**
> For specific configuration details, refer to the [OpenTelemetry Auto-Configure documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure). This resource provides information on the properties that should be configured according to your deployment requirements.

### Monitoring settings

#### Collect period

By default, **${solutionName}** collects metrics from the monitored resources every minute. To change the default collect period:

* For all your resources, add the `collectPeriod` parameter just before the `resourceGroups` section:

    ```yaml
    collectPeriod: 2m

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific resource, add the `collectPeriod` parameter in the relevant configuration related to your resource (e.g: myHost1)

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            collectPeriod: 1m30s # Customized 
    ```

> **Warning**: Collecting metrics too frequently can cause CPU-intensive workloads.

#### Connectors

**${solutionName}** comes with the *Basic Connector Library* whereas the *Enterprise edition* includes hundreds of hardware connectors that describe how to discover components and detect failures. When running **${solutionName}**, the connectors are automatically selected based on the device type provided and the enabled protocols. However, you have the flexibility to specify which connectors should be utilized or omitted.

The `connectors` parameter allows you to enforce, select, or exclude specific connectors. Connector names or category tags should be separated by commas, as illustrated in the example below:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    resources:
      myHost1:
        attributes:
          host.name: my-host-01
          host.type: win
        protocols:
          wmi:
            timeout: 120s
            username: myusername
            password: mypwd
        connectors: [ +VMwareESX4i, +VMwareESXi, "#system" ]
```

- To force a connector, precede the connector identifier with a plus sign (`+`), as in `+MIB2`.
- To exclude a connector from automatic detection, precede the connector identifier with a minus sign (`-`), like `-MIB2`.
- To stage a connector for processing by automatic detection, configure the connector identifier, for instance, `MIB2`.
- To stage a category of connectors for processing by automatic detection, precede the category tag with a hash (`#`), such as `#hardware` or `#system`.
- To exclude a category of connectors from automatic detection, precede the category tag to be excluded with a minus and a hash sign (`-#`), such as `-#system`.
  
> **Notes**: 
>- Any misspelled connector will be ignored.
>- Misspelling a category tag will prevent automatic detection from functioning due to an empty connectors staging.

##### Examples

- Example 1:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "#hardware" ]
  ```
  The core engine will automatically detect connectors categorized under `hardware`.

- Example 2:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "-#hardware", "#system" ]
  ```
  The core engine will perform automatic detection on connectors categorized under `system`, excluding those categorized under `hardware`.

- Example 3:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ DiskPart, MIB2, "#system" ]
  ```
  The core engine will automatically detect connectors named `DiskPart`, `MIB2`, and all connectors under the `system` category.

- Example 4:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ +DiskPart, MIB2, "#system" ]
  ```
  The core engine will enforce the execution of the `DiskPart` connector and then proceed with the automatic detection of `MIB2` and all connectors under the `system` category.

- Example 5:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ DiskPart, "-#system" ] 
  ```
  The core engine will perform automatic detection exclusively on the `DiskPart` connector.

- Example 6:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ +Linux, MIB2 ] 
  ```
  The core engine will enforce the execution of the `Linux` connector and subsequently perform automatic detection on the `MIB2` connector.

- Example 7:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ -Linux ] 
  ```
  The core engine will perform automatic detection on all connectors except the `Linux` connector.

- Example 8:
  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "#hardware", -MIB2 ] 
  ```
  The core engine will perform automatic detection on connectors categorized under `hardware`, excluding the `MIB2` connector.


To know which connectors are available, refer to [Basic Monitored Systems](../basic-platform-requirements.html#!) or [Enterprise Monitored Systems](../enterprise-platform-requirements.html#!).

Otherwise, you can list the available connectors using the below command:

```shell-session
$ metricshub -l
```

For more information about the `metricshub` command, refer to [MetricsHub CLI (metricshub)](../troubleshooting/cli.md).

#### Discovery cycle

**${solutionName}** periodically performs discoveries to detect new components in your monitored environment. By default, **${solutionName}** runs a discovery after 30 collects. To change this default discovery cycle:

* For all your resources, add the `discoveryCycle` just before the `resourceGroups` section:

    ```yaml
    discoveryCycle: 15

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific host, add the `discoveryCycle` parameter in the relevant configuration related to your resource (e.g: myHost1).

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            discoveryCycle: 5 # Customized 
    ```


and indicate the number of collects after which a discovery will be performed.

> **Warning**: Running discoveries too frequently can cause CPU-intensive workloads.

#### Resource Attributes

Add labels in the `attributes` section to override the data collected by the **MetricsHub Agent** or add additional attributes to the [Host Resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/host.md). These attributes are added to each metric of that *Resource* when exported to time series platforms like Prometheus. 

In the example below, we add a new `app` attribute and indicate that it is the `Jenkins` app:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    resources:
      myHost1:   
        attributes:
          host.name: my-host-01
          host.type: other
          app: Jenkins
        protocols:
          http:
            https: true
            port: 443
            username: myusername
            password: mypwd
            timeout: 60
```

#### Hostname resolution

By default, **${solutionName}** resolves the `hostname` of the resource to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and displays this value in the [Host Resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/host.md) attribute `host.name`. To display the configured hostname instead, set `resolveHostnameToFqdn` to `false`:

```yaml
resolveHostnameToFqdn: false

resourceGroups:
```

#### Job pool size

By default, **${solutionName}** runs up to 20 discovery and collect jobs in parallel. To increase or decrease the number of jobs **${solutionName}** can run simultaneously and add the `jobPoolSize` parameter just before the `resourceGroups` section:

```yaml
jobPoolSize: 40 # Customized

resourceGroups: # ...
```

> **Warning**: Running too many jobs in parallel can lead to an OutOfMemory error.

#### Sequential mode

By default, **${solutionName}** sends the queries to the resource in parallel. Although the parallel mode is faster than the sequential one, too many requests at the same time can lead to the failure of the targeted system.

To force all the network calls to be executed in sequential order:

* For all your resources, enable the `sequential` option just before the `resourceGroups` section (**NOT RECOMMENDED**):

    ```yaml
    sequential: true

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific resource, enable the `sequential` option in the relevant configuration related to your resource (e.g: myHost1)

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            sequential: true # Customized 
    ```

> **Warning**: Sending requests in sequential mode slows down the monitoring significantly. Instead of using the sequential mode, you could increase the maximum number of allowed concurrent requests in the monitored system, if the manufacturer allows it.

#### Timeout, duration and period format

Timeouts, durations and periods are specified with the below format:

| Unit | Description                     | Examples         |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| s    | seconds                         | 120s             |
| m    | minutes                         | 90m, 1m15s       |
| h    | hours                           | 1h, 1h30m        |
| d    | days (based on a 24-hour day)   | 1d               |

### OpenTelemetry Collector process settings <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

> **Note**: These settings should not be changed unless specifically required.

The **MetricsHub Agent** launches the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ as a child process by running the `otel/otelcol-contrib` executable which reads the `otel/otel-config.yaml` file to start its internal components.

To customize the way the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ process is started, update the `otelCollector` section in `config/metricshub.yaml`:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  commandLine: [<otelcol-contrib>, <arguments...>]
  environment:
    <ENV_KEY1>: <ENV_VALUE1>
    <ENV_KEY2>: <ENV_VALUE2>
    # ...
  output: log|console|silent
  workingDir: <PATH>
  disabled: false

resourceGroups: # ...
```

#### Command line

By default, the **MetricsHub Agent** launches the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ process using the following command line: `otel/otelcol-contrib --config otel/otel-config.yaml --feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName`.

If you want to run your own distribution of the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ or update the default program's arguments such as the `--feature-gates` flag, you need to override the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ default command line by setting the `commandLine` property under the `otelCollector` section:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  commandLine: 
    - /opt/metricshub/otel/my-otelcol
    - --config
    - /opt/metricshub/otel/my-otel-config.yaml
    - --feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName

resourceGroups: # ...
```

#### Disabling the collector (Not recommended)

In some cases, you might want the **MetricsHub Agent** to send OpenTelemetry signals directly to an existing _OpenTelemetry Collector_ running the `gRPC OTLP Receiver`, in which case, running a local _OpenTelemetry Collector_ is unnecessary.

To disable the _OpenTelemetry Collector_, set the `disabled` property to `true` under the `otelCollector` section:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  disabled: true

resourceGroups: # ...
```

#### Environment

When **${solutionName}** is installed as a Windows service, the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ may fail to start if it cannot connect to the Windows service controller. To address this issue, you can set the `NO_WINDOWS_SERVICE` environment variable to `1` to force the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ to be started as if it were running in an interactive terminal.

You can set additional [environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#configuration-environment-variables) to be used by the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ in the `otelCollector:environment` section (e.g.: HTTPS_PROXY):

```yaml
otelCollector:
  environment:
    HTTPS_PROXY: https://my-proxy.domain.internal.net
    NO_WINDOWS_SERVICE: 1

resourceGroups: # ...
```

#### Process output

By default, the **MetricsHub Agent** listens to the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ standard output (STDOUT) and standard error (STDERR) and streams each output line to the `logs/otelcol-<timestamp>.log` file when the logger is enabled.

To print the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ output to the console, set the `output` property to `console` under the `otelCollector` section:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  output: console  # Default: log

resourceGroups: # ...
```

To disable the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ output processor, set the `output` property to `silent` under the `otelCollector` section:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  output: silent   # Default: log

resourceGroups: # ...
```

#### Working directory

By default, the _OpenTelemetry Collector_ working directory is set to `metricshub/otel`. If your working directory is different (typically in heavily customized setups), add the `workingDir` attribute under the `otelCollector` section in `config/metricshub.yaml`:

```yaml
otelCollector:
  workingDir: /opt/metricshub/otel

resourceGroups: # ...
```

> **Important**: The _OpenTelemetry Collector_ might not start if the value set for the `workingDir` attribute is not correct, more especially if the `otel/otel-config.yaml` file uses relative paths.

### Security settings <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

#### Trusted certificates file

A TLS handshake takes place when the **MetricsHub Agent**'s `OTLP Exporter` instantiates a communication with the `OTLP gRPC Receiver`. By default, the internal `OTLP Exporter` client is configured to trust the `OTLP gRPC Receiver`'s certificate `security/otel.crt`.

If you generate a new server's certificate for the [OTLP gRPC Receiver](configure-otel.md#OTLP_gRPC), you must configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.certificate` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.certificate` parameters under the `otel` section:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.certificate: /opt/metricshub/security/new-server-cert.crt
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.certificate: /opt/metricshub/security/new-server-cert.crt

resourceGroups: # ...
```

The file should be stored in the `security` folder of the installation directory and should contain one or more X.509 certificates in PEM format.
