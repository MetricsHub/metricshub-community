description: How to configure the MetricsHub Agent to collect metrics from a variety of resources with various protocols.

# Configure the Agent

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=1|id=toc} -->

**MetricsHub** extracts metrics from any configured resource and pushes the collected data to an OTLP receiver (a.k.a OTLP endpoint).

To ensure this process runs smoothly, you need to configure a few settings in the `config/metricshub.yaml`, which is stored under:

> * `C:\ProgramData\MetricsHub\config` on Windows systems
> * `./metricshub/lib/config` on Linux systems.


> **Important**: We recommend using an editor supporting the [Schemastore](https://www.schemastore.org/json#editors) to edit **MetricsHub**'s configuration YAML files (Example: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), with [RedHat's YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)).

## Configure resources

The structure of the `config/metricshub.yaml` file allows you to organize and manage your resources in a methodical manner:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  <resource-group-name>:
    attributes:
      site: <site-name>
```

* `resourceGroups` is the highest hierarchical level grouping of all the different resource groups
* a `resource group` is a container that holds the site to be monitored
* a `site` is the data center, the server room, or any other location hosting the resources to be monitored.

If you have:

* **a highly distributed infrastructure**, you can set each of your `sites` as a `resource group` containing the different `resources` to be monitored as follows:

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      <resource-group-name>:
        resources:
          <resource-id>:
            attributes:
              host.name: <hostname>
              host.type: <type>
            <protocol-configuration>
    ```

  **Example:**

    ```yaml
      resourceGroups:
        boston:
          resources:
            myBostonHost1:
              attributes:
                host.name: my-boston-host-01
                host.type: storage
              <protocol-configuration>

            myBostonHost2:
              attributes:
                host.name: my-boston-host-02
                host.type: storage
              <protocol-configuration>

        chicago:
          resources:
            myChicagoHost1:
              attributes:
                host.name: my-chicago-host-01
                host.type: storage
              <protocol-configuration>

            myChicagoHost2:
              attributes:
                host.name: my-chicago-host-02
                host.type: storage
              <protocol-configuration>
    ```

* **a centralized infrastructure**, you can configure your resource directly under the `resources` section located at the top of the `config/metricshub.yaml` file. In that case, the `resourceGroups` attribute is not required:

    ```yaml
    resources:
      <resource-id>:
        attributes:
          host.name: <hostname>
          host.type: <type>
        <protocol-configuration>
    # resourceGroups: #
    ```

If your resources have:

* **unique characteristics**, use the syntax below for each resource:

  ```yaml
  resources:
    <resource-id>:
      attributes:
        host.name: <hostname>
        host.type: <type>
      <protocol-configuration>
    ```

* share the **same characteristics** (device type, protocols, credentials, etc.), use the syntax below:

  ```yaml
  resourceGroups:
    <resource-group-name>:
      resources:
        <resource-id>:
          attributes:
            host.names: [<hostname1>,<hostname2>, etc.]
            host.type: <type>
          <protocol-configuration>
  ```

where

* `<resource-id>` is the unique id of your resource. It can for example be the id of a host, an application, or a service
* `<hostname>` is the name or IP address of the resource; `<hostname1>,<hostname2>, etc.` is a comma-delimited list of resources to be monitored. Provide their hostname or IP address.
* `<type>` is the type of the resource to be monitored. Possible values are:
  * `win` for Microsoft Windows systems
  * `linux` for Linux systems
  * `network` for network devices
  * `oob` for Out-of-band management cards
  * `storage` for storage systems
  * `aix` for IBM AIX systems
  * `hpux` for HP UX systems
  * `solaris` for Oracle Solaris systems
  * `tru64` for HP Tru64 systems
  * `vms` for HP Open VMS systems.

* `<protocol-configuration>` is the protocol(s) **MetricsHub** will use to communicate with the resources: `http`, `ipmi`, `oscommand`, `ssh`, `snmp`, `wmi`, `wbem` or `winrm`. Refer to [Protocols and credentials](./configure-agent.html#protocols-and-credentials) for more details.

## (Optional) Customize resource monitoring

If the connectors included in **MetricsHub** do not collect the metrics you need, you can configure one or several monitors to obtain this data from your resource and specify its corresponding attributes and metrics in **MetricsHub**.

A monitor defines how **MetricsHub** collects and processes data for the resource. For each monitor, you must provide the following information:

* its name
* the type of job it performs (e.g., `simple` for straightforward monitoring tasks)
* the data sources from which metrics are collected
* how the collected metrics are mapped to **MetricsHub**'s monitoring model.

### Configuration

Follow the structure below to declare your monitor:

```yaml
<resource-group>:
  <resource-key>:
    attributes:
      # <attributes...>
    protocols:
      # <credentials...>
    monitors:
      <monitor-name>:
        <job>: # Job type, e.g., "simple"
          sources:
            <source-name>:
              # <source-content>
          mapping:
            source: <mapping-source-reference>
            attributes:
              # <attributes-mapping...>
            metrics:
              # <metrics-mapping...>
```

Refer to [Monitors](../develop/monitors.md) for more information on how to configure custom resource monitoring.

### Example: Monitoring a Grafana Service

In the example below, we configured a monitor for a Grafana service. This monitor collects data from the Grafana health API and maps the response to the most relevant attributes and metrics in **MetricsHub**.

Refer to [monitors documentation page](../develop/monitors.md) for more information on how to configrue the monitors.

### Example: Monitoring a Grafana Service

In the example below, we configured a monitor for a Grafana service. This monitor collects data from the Grafana health API and maps the response to the most relevant attributes and metrics in **MetricsHub**.

## Configure the OTLP Receiver

By default, the **MetricsHub Agent** pushes the collected metrics to the [`OTLP Receiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver/otlpreceiver) through gRPC on port **TCP/4317**. To push data to the OTLP receiver of your choice:

* locate the `otel` section in your configuration file
* configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint` parameters as follows:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint: https://<my-host>:4317
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint: https://<my-host>:4317

resourceGroups: #...
```

where `<my-host>` should be replaced with the hostname or IP address of the server where the OTLP receiver is installed.

Use the below syntax if you wish to push metrics to the Prometheus OTLP Receiver:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.metrics.exporter: otlp
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.endpoint: http://<prom-server-host>:9090/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.protocol: http/protobuf
```

where `<prom-server-host>` should be replaced with the hostname or IP address of the server where *Prometheus* is running.

> **Note:**
> For specific configuration details, refer to the [OpenTelemetry Auto-Configure documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure). This resource provides information about the properties to be configured depending on your deployment requirements.

#### Trusted certificates file

If an `OTLP Receiver` certificate is required, configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.certificate` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.certificate` parameters under the `otel` section:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.certificate: /opt/metricshub/security/new-server-cert.crt
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.certificate: /opt/metricshub/security/new-server-cert.crt

resourceGroups: # ...
```

The file should contain one or more X.509 certificates in PEM format.

## (Optional) Additional settings

### Authentication settings

#### Basic authentication header

If your `OTLP Receiver` requires authentication headers, configure the `otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers` and `otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers` parameters under the `otel` section:

```yaml
otel:
  otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.headers: <custom-header1>
  otel.exporter.otlp.logs.headers: <custom-header2>

resourceGroups: # ...
```

### Monitoring settings

#### Collect period

By default, **MetricsHub** collects metrics from the monitored resources every minute. To change the default collect period:

* For all your resources, add the `collectPeriod` parameter just before the `resourceGroups` section:

    ```yaml
    collectPeriod: 2m

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific resource, add the `collectPeriod` parameter at the resource level. In the example below, we set the `collectPeriod` to `1m30s` for `myHost1`:

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            collectPeriod: 1m30s # Customized
    ```

> **Warning**: Collecting metrics too frequently can cause CPU-intensive workloads.

#### Connectors

When running **MetricsHub**, the connectors are automatically selected based on the device type provided and the enabled protocols. However, you have the flexibility to specify which connectors should be utilized or omitted.

The `connectors` parameter allows you to force, select, or exclude specific connectors. Connector names or category tags should be separated by commas, as illustrated in the example below:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    resources:
      myHost1:
        attributes:
          host.name: my-host-01
          host.type: win
        protocols:
          wmi:
            timeout: 120s
            username: myusername
            password: mypwd
        connectors: [ +VMwareESX4i, +VMwareESXi, "#system" ]
```

* To force a connector, precede the connector identifier with a plus sign (`+`), as in `+MIB2`.
* To exclude a connector from automatic detection, precede the connector identifier with a minus sign (`-`), like `-MIB2`.
* To stage a connector for processing by automatic detection, configure the connector identifier, for instance, `MIB2`.
* To stage a category of connectors for processing by automatic detection, precede the category tag with a hash (`#`), such as `#hardware` or `#system`.
* To exclude a category of connectors from automatic detection, precede the category tag to be excluded with a minus and a hash sign (`-#`), such as `-#system`.

> **Notes**:
>
>* Any misspelled connector will be ignored.
>* Misspelling a category tag will prevent automatic detection from functioning due to an empty connectors staging.

##### Examples

* Example 1:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "#hardware" ]
  ```

 The core engine will automatically detect connectors categorized under `hardware`.

* Example 2:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "-#hardware", "#system" ]
  ```

  The core engine will perform automatic detection on connectors categorized under `system`, excluding those categorized under `hardware`.

* Example 3:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ DiskPart, MIB2, "#system" ]
  ```

  The core engine will automatically detect connectors named `DiskPart`, `MIB2`, and all connectors under the `system` category.

* Example 4:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ +DiskPart, MIB2, "#system" ]
  ```

  The core engine will force the execution of the `DiskPart` connector and then proceed with the automatic detection of `MIB2` and all connectors under the `system` category.

* Example 5:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ DiskPart, "-#system" ]
  ```

  The core engine will perform automatic detection exclusively on the `DiskPart` connector.

* Example 6:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ +Linux, MIB2 ]
  ```

  The core engine will force the execution of the `Linux` connector and subsequently perform automatic detection on the `MIB2` connector.

* Example 7:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ -Linux ]
  ```

  The core engine will perform automatic detection on all connectors except the `Linux` connector.

* Example 8:

  ```yaml
  connectors: [ "#hardware", -MIB2 ]
  ```

  The core engine will perform automatic detection on connectors categorized under `hardware`, excluding the `MIB2` connector.

To know which connectors are available, refer to [Community Connector Platforms](../platform-requirements.html#!).

Otherwise, you can list the available connectors using the below command:

```shell-session
$ metricshub -l
```

For more information about the `metricshub` command, refer to [MetricsHub CLI (metricshub)](../troubleshooting/cli.md).

#### Discovery cycle

**MetricsHub** periodically performs discoveries to detect new components in your monitored environment. By default, **MetricsHub** runs a discovery after 30 collects. To change this default discovery cycle:

* For all your resources, add the `discoveryCycle` just before the `resourceGroups` section:

    ```yaml
    discoveryCycle: 15

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific host, add the `discoveryCycle` parameter at the resource level and indicate the number of collects after which a discovery will be performed. In the example below, we set the `discoveryCycle` to be performed after `5` collects for `myHost1`:

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            discoveryCycle: 5 # Customized
    ```

> **Warning**: Running discoveries too frequently can cause CPU-intensive workloads.

#### Resource Attributes

Add labels in the `attributes` section to override the data collected by the **MetricsHub Agent** or add additional attributes to the [Host Resource](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host/). These attributes are added to each metric of that *Resource* when exported to time series platforms like Prometheus.

In the example below, we added a new `app` attribute and indicated that this is the `Jenkins` app:

```yaml
resourceGroups:
  boston:
    resources:
      myHost1:
        attributes:
          host.name: my-host-01
          host.type: other
          app: Jenkins
        protocols:
          http:
            https: true
            port: 443
            username: myusername
            password: mypwd
            timeout: 60
```

#### Hostname resolution

By default, **MetricsHub** resolves the `hostname` of the resource to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and displays this value in the [Host Resource](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host/) attribute `host.name`. To display the configured hostname instead, set `resolveHostnameToFqdn` to `false`:

```yaml
resolveHostnameToFqdn: false

resourceGroups:
```

#### Job pool size

By default, **MetricsHub** runs up to 20 discovery and collect jobs in parallel. To increase or decrease the number of jobs **MetricsHub** can run simultaneously, add the `jobPoolSize` parameter just before the `resourceGroups` section:

```yaml
jobPoolSize: 40 # Customized

resourceGroups: # ...
```

> **Warning**: Running too many jobs in parallel can lead to an OutOfMemory error.

#### Sequential mode

By default, **MetricsHub** sends the queries to the resource in parallel. Although the parallel mode is faster than the sequential one, too many requests at the same time can lead to the failure of the targeted system.

To force all the network calls to be executed in sequential order:

* For all your resources, add the `sequential` parameter before the `resourceGroups` section (**NOT RECOMMENDED**) and set it to `true`:

    ```yaml
    sequential: true

    resourceGroups: # ...
    ```

* For a specific resource, add the `sequential` parameter at the resource level and set it to `true`. In the example below, we enabled the `sequential` mode for `myHost1`

    ```yaml
    resourceGroups:
      boston:
        resources:
          myHost1:
            attributes:
              host.name: my-host-01
              host.type: linux
            protocols:
              snmp:
                version: v1
                community: public
                port: 161
                timeout: 120s
            sequential: true # Customized
    ```

> **Warning**: Sending requests in sequential mode slows down the monitoring significantly. Instead of using the sequential mode, you can increase the maximum number of allowed concurrent requests in the monitored system, if the manufacturer allows it.

#### Timeout, duration and period format

Timeouts, durations and periods are specified with the below format:

| Unit | Description                     | Examples         |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| s    | seconds                         | 120s             |
| m    | minutes                         | 90m, 1m15s       |
| h    | hours                           | 1h, 1h30m        |
| d    | days (based on a 24-hour day)   | 1d               |
