It efficiently communicates the gathered metrics to any platform compatible with OpenTelemetry.

# Overview

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

**${solutionName}** functions as a universal metrics collector for OpenTelemetry, allowing customization for overseeing diverse technologies, encompassing applications, servers, and devices, particularly those without readily available monitoring solutions.

The enterprise edition includes the capability to monitor the hardware health of different computers, network switches, and storage systems and reports the power consumption, electricity costs and COâ‚‚ emissions to support SRE initiatives.

The agent exposes tailored metrics to any observability platform supporting [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs), including [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), [BMC Helix](https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/bmc-helix.html), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), Splunk, and more.
