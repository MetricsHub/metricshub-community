description: MetricsHub is a universal metrics collection agent for OpenTelemetry, which extracts metrics from any resource and pushes them to any observability back-end.

# Overview

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

**MetricsHubÂ®** is a universal metrics collection solution for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs) which **extracts metrics from any local or remote resource** - such as a host, service, or application - and **pushes the collected data to any observability back-end** supporting OpenTelemetry like Prometheus, New Relic, ServiceNow, and Splunk.

## Operating Principle

**MetricsHub** acts as an agent within the infrastructure. It pulls data from systems and applications using various protocols like `SNMP`, `WMI`, `REST APIs`, or `SSH`.

**MetricsHub**  includes a library of YAML files - called **connectors** - which describe how to collect metrics about [operating systems and a variety of platforms.](metricshub-connectors-directory.html)

**MetricsHub**  uses the OTLP protocol to send metrics to observability platforms that support OpenTelemetry natively like Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus, and Splunk.

Because it is recommended to use an OpenTelemetry Collector in a production environment, **MetricsHub Enterprise** is bundled with OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib to facilitate connections to over [30 different observability platforms](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?component=exporter).

## Monitoring Coverage

**MetricsHub Enterprise** provides out-of-the box support for hundreds of  [servers, storage systems, network devices, and databases](metricshub-connectors-directory.html) through its built-in library of connectors.

Fully customizable, **MetricsHub** can also be configured to **cover new use cases in no time**, such as the monitoring of systems or applications not covered out-of-the-box through protocols like `HTTP`, `IPMI`, `JMX`, `PING`, `SNMP`, `SSH`, `WBEM`, `WinRM` or `WMI`.

## Main Features

* **Remote Monitoring**: Gathers metrics from remote systems using various protocols like `HTTP`, `IPMI`, `JMX`, `PING`, `SNMP`, `SSH`, `WBEM`, `WinRM` or `WMI`.
* **OpenTelemetry native**: Pulls metrics from diverse systems and applications while strictly adhering to OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions.
* **Out-of-the-box support for 200+ systems and apps**.
* **Extensible**: Adds support for new systems, platforms, or applications with just a few lines of YAML.
