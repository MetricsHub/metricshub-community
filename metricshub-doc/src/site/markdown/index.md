description: ${solutionName} is an open source distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector, designed to oversee diverse devices, applications, services, and hardware components across computers, network switches, and storage systems. It efficiently communicates the gathered metrics to any platform compatible with OpenTelemetry.

# Overview

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

**${solutionName}** functions as a universal metrics collector for OpenTelemetry, allowing customization for overseeing diverse technologies, encompassing applications, servers, and devices, particularly those without readily available monitoring solutions.

The **enterprise edition** includes the capability to monitor the hardware health of different computers, network switches, and storage systems and reports the power consumption, electricity costs and COâ‚‚ emissions to support SRE initiatives.

The agent exposes tailored metrics to any observability platform supporting [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs), including [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), [BMC Helix](https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/bmc-helix.html), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), Splunk, and more.


![**${solutionName}** Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

**${solutionName}** is available in 2 editions:

* **Community edition**: it includes fundamental features of the solution and connectors developed or contributed by the community members.
The MetricsHub foundation enables the monitoring of both Windows and Linux systems and collecting metrics exposed by MIB2 and LibreHardwareMonitor.
Additionally, the MetricsHub empowers users to create directives specifying how to monitor any resource with minimal configuration, involving low-code principles.

* **Enterprise edition**: In addition to the features included in the community edition, the enterprise edition includes the library of 250+ *Hardware Connectors*, **${solutionName}** becomes capable of performing the monitoring of almost any system from any manufacturer (**Cisco**, **Dell**, **EMC**, **Fujitsu**, **Hitachi**, **HP**, **IBM**, **Lenovo**, **NetApp**, **Oracle**, etc.) through `SNMP`, `IPMI`, `HTTP`, `WBEM`, `WMI`, `WINRM` or `SSH`.


  *${solutionName}* monitors the health of the internal electronic components of the system:

  * Batteries
  * Blades
  * CPUs
  * GPUs
  * LEDs
  * Memory modules
  * Network cards
  * Power supplies
  * Robotics
  * Sensors
      * Temperatures
      * Voltages
      * Fans
      * Power
  * Storage
      * Controllers
      * Disks
      * RAIDs
      * HBAs
      * LUNs
      * Tape drives
  * Virtual Machines
  * etc.

  *${solutionName}* also reports the energy usage and costs, as well as the carbon emissions of the monitored systems.

## What's in the box?

**${solutionName}** is comprised of:

* The **MetricsHub Agent**
    * Its [configuration file](configuration/configure-agent.md) (`metricshub.yaml`)
    * The monitoring engine, with the basic connectors: Windows, Linux, MIB2, Libre Hardware Monitor 
* The *OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib* executable
    * The *OpenTelemetry* [configuration file](configuration/configure-otel.md) (`otel-config.yaml`)
* MetricsHub CLI (`metricshub`)

> Note: The **Enterprise Edition** consists of Hardware connectors

> Note: **${solutionName}** is shipped with Java Runtime Environment 17.

### MetricsHub Agent

The **MetricsHub Agent** is the engine that performs the actual monitoring of the systems, based on its [configuration file](configuration/configure-agent.md), which specifies:

* Its internal polling cycle
* The hostnames and credentials of the resources to monitor.

The **MetricsHub Agent** is responsible for:

1. Spawning the **OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib**
2. Scraping resources
3. Collecting metrics
4. Pushing OTLP data to the OTLP receiver of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

### OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

The *OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib* is responsible for:

1. Pulling its metrics periodically (internally)
2. Pushing these metrics to the specified platform.

### Hardware Connector Library (Enterprise edition)

In the enterprise edition, the library of **250+** *Hardware Connectors* is provided as zip asset to be included in the **${solutionName}** installation. It is the same library that powers [Hardware Sentry KM for PATROL](https://www.sentrysoftware.com/products/km-hardware-sentry.html), the original and battle-seasoned module for PATROL, created in 2004 by Sentry Software and used on hundreds of thousands of systems around the world.

The platforms that can be monitored by **${solutionName}** entirely depends on this library. More details about the *Hardware Connector Library* are available as a [separate documentation](https://www.sentrysoftware.com/docs/hardware-connectors/latest/index.html).

### MetricsHub CLI (`metricshub`)

The [MetricsHub CLI](troubleshooting/cli.md) contains the same engine and library as *MetricsHub Agent*, but packaged as a command line interface, that can be invoked in a shell.

This tool is particularly useful to troubleshoot the monitoring of a system, protocols and credentials.
