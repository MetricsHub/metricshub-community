# Overview

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=1|id=toc} -->

Two editions are available for **MetricsHub**: the **Community Edition** and the **Enterprise Edition**. The installation procedures differ depending on which edition you are using.

The **Enterprise Edition** is delivered with installable packages, making the installation process smoother. In contrast, the **Community Edition** comes with archives that need to be unzipped in a specific directory, and additional commands may need to be run.

The **Enterprise Edition** includes a 30-day trial period. During this time, you can obtain assistance from [MetricsHub's Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/metricshub/shared_invite/zt-2acx4uglx-Gl4pQZYvoVedDXGF3~C5NQ).

No license is required for the trial period. If, after the 30-day trial period, you wish to purchase **MetricsHub**, you can contact Sentry Software directly or through a specific partner. Once the purchase is complete, Sentry Software will provide you with a license key that needs to be copied into the `metricshub.yaml` file.
