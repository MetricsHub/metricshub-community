description: How to configure the self-monitoring of ${solutionName}.

# Self-Monitoring <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=3|id=toc} -->

> **Important**: Self-monitoring is intended to help advanced users debug or troubleshoot **${solutionName}**. We recommend using it cautiously, as an incorrect configuration can lead to monitoring issues.

**${solutionName}** can monitor itself, granting you a way to access additional metrics, such as the number of requests for a specific protocol, or the current state of the JVM.
Using the **OpenTelemetry Java Agent**, **${solutionName}** can export traces and metrics of the **MetricsHub Agent** to observe its own performance.

Those traces provide you with a complementary way to troubleshoot any problem arising.
They describe the internal "path" that the **${solutionName}** application takes to execute its internal tasks and offer a clear overview of what is happening when a problem appears.

**Self-Monitoring** generates a variety of **traces** and tracks every protocol request such as:

* HTTP
* IPMI
* OS Command
* SNMP
* SSH
* WBEM
* WinRM
* WMI 

The **metrics** range from the number of requests sent for each protocol to the latency measured for each request.

All the JVM metrics have the same attributes:
`host.arch`, `host.name`, `os.description`, `os.type`, `pool`, `process.command_line`, `process.executable.path`, `process.pid`, `process.runtime.description`, `process.runtime.name`, `process.runtime.name`, `process.runtime.version`, `service.name`, `service`, `telemetry.auto.version`, `telemetry.sdk.language`, `telemetry.sdk.name`, `telemetry.sdkversion`, `type`, `host`.

## Self-monitoring the agent

The **Self-Monitoring** feature is **disabled by default**. Follow the steps below to activate it.

### Enable OpenTelemetry traces

In order to export the traces to the observability back-end, comment out the traces pipeline inside the `otel/otel-config.yaml` file and configure the exporter.

```yaml
traces:  
  receivers: [otlp]  
  processors: [memory_limiter, batch, resourcedetection]  
  exporters: [logging, datadog/api] # List here the platforms on which you want to see the traces
```

### Configure Java Options

Now that the traces pipeline is configured, you need to add Java options to properly link the **OpenTelemetry Java Agent** to the **MetricsHub Agent** and configure the service and the exporter.

>**Warning**: you must change the `service.name` property if you are using multiple **MetricsHub Agents**, so each service has a unique identifier. Otherwise, the observability back-end will aggregate the services together, resulting in issues regarding latency and information loss.

#### On Windows

Add the following options to the `MetricsHubServiceManager.cfg` file located in `C:\Program Files\MetricsHub\app`.

```java
java-options=-javaagent:otel\opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
java-options=-Dotel.resource.attributes=service.namespace=SentrySoftware.MetricsHub,service.name=MetricsHub-Agent
java-options=-Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp
java-options=-Dotel.metrics.exporter=otlp
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://localhost:4317
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.certificate=security\otel.crt
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.headers=Authorization=Basic aHdzOlNlbnRyeVNvZnR3YXJlMSE=
```

#### On Linux

Add the following options to the `service.cfg` file located in `/opt/metricshub/lib/app`.

```java
java-options=-javaagent:/opt/metricshub/otel/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
java-options=-Dotel.resource.attributes=service.namespace=SentrySoftware.MetricsHub,service.name=MetricsHub-Agent
java-options=-Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp
java-options=-Dotel.metrics.exporter=otlp
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://localhost:4317
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.certificate=/opt/metricshub/security/otel.crt
java-options=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.headers=Authorization=Basic aHdzOlNlbnRyeVNvZnR3YXJlMSE=
```

## Trace example

The traces are made of spans that describe the current state of **${solutionName}**. Every time a request is sent, a span is created. This is what a span looks like:

```log
ScopeSpans #0
 ScopeSpans SchemaURL: 
 InstrumentationScope io.opentelemetry.okhttp-3.0 1.21.0-alpha
 Span #0
     Trace ID       : 1aff7feca80d8ad289fdac5a0e084912
     Parent ID      : 8921469e0196781e
     ID             : 7f4482078c119a15
     Name           : HTTP POST
     Kind           : Client
     Start time     : 2022-12-21 11:38:30.9002252 +0000 UTC
     End time       : 2022-12-21 11:38:31.1696872 +0000 UTC
     Status code    : Unset
     Status message : 
 Attributes:
      -> thread.id: Int(33)
      -> http.url: Str(https://localhost:4317/opentelemetry.proto.collector.metrics.v1.MetricsService/Export)
      -> http.method: Str(POST)
      -> thread.name: Str(OkHttp https://localhost:4317/...)
      -> net.peer.name: Str(localhost)
      -> net.transport: Str(ip_tcp)
      -> net.peer.port: Int(4317)
      -> http.user_agent: Str(OTel OTLP Exporter Java/1.21.0)
      -> http.flavor: Str(2.0)
      -> http.status_code: Int(200)
```

A span is made of 3 main parts:

1. `ScopeSpans #n1`, n1 being the number associated to this group of spans.

2. `Span #n2`, n2 being the current span number inside this scope of spans.
   There are common attributes to every span:
    * `Trace ID`: Unique ID of the trace.
    * `Parent ID`: Unique ID of the parent span (empty for root spans).
    * `ID`: Unique ID of the span.
    * `Name`: Name of the span, typically describing the step currently tracked by the span.
    * `Kind`: Type of the span, either `Internal` for an internal operation within MetricsHub or `Client` for [clients](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md#libraries--frameworks) automatically supported by the [opentelemetry-javaagent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) such as [HttpUrlConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html).
    * `Start time`: Timestamp marking the beginning of the span's lifecycle.
    * `End time`: Timestamp marking the end of the span's lifecycle.
    * `Status code`: Status code of the span, either `Unset` or `Error`.
    * `Status message`: Message associated to the `Status code`.

3. `Attributes`, providing additional information about the current operation being tracked by the span. Attributes are specific to each span. A span tracking an HTTP request will not have the same attributes as a span tracking an SNMP request.
