# Health Check

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

## Check the collector is up and running

Verify that both processes are running:

* `otelcol-contrib` <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>
* `metricshub/bin/service`

On Windows, you will need to verify the status of the **MetricsHub** service.

## Check the collector status <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

Connect to [`http://localhost:13133`](http://localhost:13133), which typically responds with:

```
{"status":"Server available","upSince":"2021-10-25T00:59:24.340626+02:00","uptime":"12h12m21.5832293s"}
```

Alternatively, you can use *cURL*:

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:13133
{"status":"Server available","upSince":"2021-10-25T00:59:24.340626+02:00","uptime":"12h13m33.8777673s"}
```

## Check the pipelines status <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

Add `zpages` in the `service:extensions` section of the **otel/otel-config.yaml** file:

```yaml
service:
  extensions: [health_check,zpages] # <-- Added zpages
  # [...]
```

Restart the *Collector*.

Connect to:

* [`http://localhost:55679/debug/servicez`](http://localhost:55679/debug/servicez) for general information about the Collector
* [`http://localhost:55679/debug/pipelinez`](http://localhost:55679/debug/pipelinez) for details about the active pipeline
* [`http://localhost:55679/debug/tracez`](http://localhost:55679/debug/tracez) for activity details of each receiver and exporter in the pipeline

## Check the collector is running properly <span class="badge">Enterprise</span>

The *OpenTelemetry Collector* runs an internal Prometheus Exporter on port 8888, exposing metrics related to its operations, notably the number of metrics being processed in its pipeline, and how many errors have been encountered pushing these metrics to the outside.

These metrics can be scraped with a *Prometheus Server*, or simply visualized by connecting to `http://localhost:8888/metrics`.

The above processor time utilization and memory consumption metrics pertain to the `otelcol-contrib` process only, and do not represent the activity of the internal **MetricsHub Agent**.

You can choose to integrate these internal metrics in the pipeline of the *OpenTelemetry Collector* to push them to the platform of your choice. To do so, [edit the otel/otel-config.yaml configuration file](../configuration/configure-otel.md) to add `prometheus/internal` in the list of receivers:

```yaml
# [...]

# ACTUAL COLLECTOR PIPELINE DESCRIPTION
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: info # Change to debug for more details
  extensions: [health_check]
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus/internal]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch, resourcedetection, metricstransform]
      exporters: [...] # List here the platform of your choice
```
