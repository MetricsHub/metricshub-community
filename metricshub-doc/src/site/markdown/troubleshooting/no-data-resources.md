description: How to resolve issues where MetricsHub fails to collect data for a specific resource.

# No Data for a Specific Resource

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

**MetricsHub** extracts metrics from resources based on the [protocols and credentials](../configuration/configure-monitoring.md#protocols-and-credentials) defined in the `config/metricshub.yaml` file. If a connectivity issue occurs between **MetricsHub** and the configured resource, data collection will fail.

To troubleshoot this issue, test the connection to the resource using the CLI associated with the protocol specified in `config/metricshub.yaml`. Use the credentials configured in the file. If the CLI returns:

* **An error**: Verify that the credentials and protocol settings in the configuration file are correct
* **A successful output**: Confirm that the query retrieves the expected data.

For detailed guidance, refer to the protocol-specific CLI documentation.
