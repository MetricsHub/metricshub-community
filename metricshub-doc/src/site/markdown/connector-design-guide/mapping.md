# Mapping

This page describes how to map metrics and attributes in a connector file.

## Format

```yaml
connector:
  # ...

monitors:
  <monitorType>: # <object> 
    <job>: # <object>
      # ...
      mapping:
        source: $monitors.enclosure.discovery.sources.Source(7)
        attributes:
          <key>: # <string>
        metrics:
          <key>: # <string>
        conditionalCollection:
          <key>: # <string>
```

## Metric Categories

Metrics are separated in different categories:
* Attributes: They are the intrinsic values of your monitor, like its name, identifier number, serial number...
* Metrics: They are the performance data of your monitor at the time of collect.
* ConditionalCollection: The monitor will be collected only if all its conditional collections have value.

## Mapping Functions
* buildId
* lookupParentId
* buildName
* FakeCounter
* Rate
