description: How ${project.name} exposes hardware metrics.

## Metrics

**${project.name}** collects the health metrics of all the hardware components that compose your servers, network switches, or storage systems and exposes them as *Monitors* in your monitoring platform(s). Information specific to each *Monitor* is provided as *Attributes* to help you distinguish *Monitor instances*. *device_id*, *host.name*, *vendor*, *serial_number*, *model* are for example some of the *Attributes* available for physical disks.

The table below provides detailed information about the metrics scrapped by **${project.name}** for each Monitor and metric type.
