/**
 * Service provider interface for contributing {@link JdbcDriverDescriptor}s to the
 * {@link JdbcDriverRegistry}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are discovered via {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} from the extension
 * classloader. Each provider returns a collection of descriptors; the registry aggregates them and
 * resolves driver lookups by {@code (driverClass, explicitJarPath)} or by URL prefix.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of providers are expected in practice:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A <em>built-in provider</em> shipped inside {@code metricshub-jdbc-extension.jar} that
 *       advertises the shaded drivers (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2) with
 *       {@link DriverOrigin#BUILT_IN}.</li>
 *   <li><em>Descriptor-only providers</em> (also shipped in the JDBC extension) that advertise
 *       well-known external drivers (Oracle, SQL Server, JTOpen, ...) without bundling the JAR.
 *       The registry then resolves the JAR from the operator-default drivers directory at first
 *       use — {@code /opt/metricshub/lib/extensions/jdbc/} on Linux,
 *       {@code C:\Program Files\MetricsHub\extensions\jdbc\} on Windows.</li>
 * </ul>
